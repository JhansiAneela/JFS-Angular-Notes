
1. Easy to use and similar to Angular js.
2. Two way data binding with ngModel.
3. Bulky HTML code and minimal component code.
4. Automatically tracks the form and form elements state and validity.

Drawbacks :--

5. unit testing is a challenge.
6. Readability decreases with complex forms and validations.

*** When u make a small forms for that unit testing can be handled with the browser then u can cantemplate driven forms.

*** When u make a complex forms for that unit testing must be necessary then u can go reactive forms.
