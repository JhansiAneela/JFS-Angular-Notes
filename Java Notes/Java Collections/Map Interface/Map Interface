
Map Interface :-
-------------------
1. Map contains the value on the basis of key. i.e; key-value pair.
2. Each key and value pair is known as an entry. A Map contains unique keys.
3. A Map is useful if you have to search, update or delete elements on the basis of a key.
4. Map doesnot allow duplicate keys but allow duplicate values.

5. Two interfaces : Map and SortedMap, 
   Three classes  : HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap. 

6. HashMap and LinkedHashMap allow null keys and values, but TreeMap doesn't allow any null key or value.
