--------------------------------
1. Array list uses dynamic array                  , linked list uses doubly linked list to store the elements
2. Manipulation is slow                           , Manipulation is fast
3. Better for storing & accessing the data        , Better for manipulating the data
4. Array list acts as list only                   , Linked list acts as list and queue
5. memory allocation is contiguos                 , memory allocation is not contigous
6. Default capacity is 10 to create array list    , here there is no default capacity
