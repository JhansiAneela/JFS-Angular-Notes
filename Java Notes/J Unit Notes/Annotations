
Annotation :-
-------------------
1. Annotation is a feature introduced in java 5

2. Annotation is used to add metadata to java source code.

3. This will allow you to add information to an existing data object in your source code.

4. Java allows users to define their own annotations.

5. Annotation can be described using "@" symbol.

6. Junit annotations will direct the execution flow of the program.



@Test :-
------------
1. Denotes that a method is a test method.

Can we use @test at class level? :-
---------------------------------------------
If a class have a huge number of test cases then adding @test annotation is a little bit difficult in that case we can use the @test annotation in the class level.



@BeforeEach :-
------------------
1. Denotes that the annotated method should be executed before each @Test, @RepeatedTest,      @PrameterisedTest, or Test factory method in the current class.

2. The @Before annotation is used when different test cases share the same logic. 
3. The method with the @Before annotation always runs before the execution of each test case.
4. This annotation is commonly used to develop necessary preconditions for each @Test method.
